# WDI-Fourth-Project

Playlister was my forth and final project while at GA, the premise of it was to be able to search the YouTube API to pull in tracks and artists that you like and save them to your profile so you don't lose track of them, there was also the ability to follow other users so you can keep track of the music they are in to.

## Technologies Used

* CSS
* JavaScript
* Node.js

## Challenges Faced
Even though I feel comfortable using React I felt this project I came across quite a few challenges, but after some time away from the code and doing something else for a while I came back and was able to get over my problems. In particular I struggled implementing the YouTube API.

## What I Liked About This Project
I had a lot of fun during this project mainly because I felt like I was getting the hang of React, I enjoy styling a lot and being able to create something from scratch and make it look how you want is a great feeling. Although I am happy with the styling I would like to make some tweaks and adjustments.

## Whats Next
Moving forward there are a few things I would like to add to this project, again I would like to rework some of the styling, I would like to add a unfollow function and add some user feedback to show when you've added a track or followed a user.
